      <h2>Why do ghosts exist?</h2>
      <p>Ghosts and spirits are generally believed to be tethered to this world for different reasons depending on what kind of ghost they are, however the most accepted opinion on this 
        is the belief that it is unfinished business or high running emotions at time of death that disrupts the ghosts ability to rest which could be guilt, sadness or in most cases vengeance.

          <h2>Why this guide was made </h2>
          <p>Phasmaphobia is a horror game that can be intimidating to new players who pick it up, with 24 ghost types it is not strange to see how nearly half the playerbase has quit the game due to difficulty adjusting and adapting to the complicated game mechanics.
            While the game itself is well made it has passed the stage where it is welcoming and is now mostly played by those who have stuck with the game since the beginning not leaving room for amateurs, this guide will hopefully point you towards all the right places to get you on your feet and ready to go.
